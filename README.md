This project was created as a final exam for the programming course
at Blue EdTech. Projeto Carmen is a choose-your-own-adventure type
of game run directly from Terminal using Python. 

## Why this game exists?
The final exam for the programming course at Blue EdTech was the creation of a

## Install
Out-of-the-box, you'll need to install Python and Pygame and then clone this 
repository or click the blue shield at the top that says 'Open in Visual 
Studio Code' if you have VSCode installed.

### Installing Python and Pygame
This project was created using Python v3.9.5 as programming language and
Pygame as a gamming library for Python.
You may use down to Python v3.6 but we strongly recommend a newer version.
Python v3.5 or below is not supported since we use the `f-string` String
Formatting Syntax available only on Python v3.6 and newer. 
We provide info as how to install Python on Windows and Ubuntu.

#### Windows
If you're on Windows, you can head to Python's download page to download an
executable (.exe) for quick installation. Choose the latest version.
[Click here](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/) to download Python.

After installing Python, run the following command on your PowerShell or 
Terminal window to install Pygame only for the local user instead of globally:
```
python -m pip install -U pygame --user
```

#### Linux-based systems
We'll show how to download and install Python on Ubuntu OS. The instructions
for other systems might be similar.

* Install  the `deadsnakes` PPA to get the latest Python available
```
$ sudo apt-get install software-properties-common
$ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:deadsnakes/ppa
```

* Install Python 3.9
```
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install python3.9
```

After installing Python, run the following command on your Terminal window to 
install Pygame only for the local user instead of globally:
```
python3 -m pip install -U pygame --user
```
