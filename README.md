**Projeto de Conclusão do Módulo 1 - Blue EdTech**
This project was created as a final exam for the programming course
at Blue EdTech. Projeto Carmen is a choose-your-own-adventure type
of game run directly from Terminal using Python. 

## Install
Out-of-the-box, you'll need to install Python and then clone this repository
or click the blue shield at the top that says 'Open in Visual Studio Code' if
you have VSCode installed.

### Installing Python
This project was created using Python v3.9.5 as programming language.
You may use down to Python v3.6 but we strongly recommend a newer version.
Python v3.5 or below is not supported since we use the `f-string` String
Formatting Syntax available only on Python v3.6 and newer. 
We provide info as how to install Python on Windows and Ubuntu.

#### Windows
If you're on Windows, you can head to Python's download page to download an
executable (.exe) for quick installation. Choose the latest version.
[Click here](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/) to download Python.

#### Linux-based systems
We'll show how to download and install Python on Ubuntu OS. The instructions
for other systems might be similar.

* Install  the `deadsnakes` PPA to get the latest Python available
```
